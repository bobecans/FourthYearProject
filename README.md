# FourthYearProject
These are the code samples i used during my final year project in software development.
In this files, I look at Computer vision techniques and Conv Neural Networks.

The plan is to predict what weather is in any given image.

The Document for this project can be found at this website address: http://glasnost.itcarlow.ie/~softeng4/C00196960/index.html

In the Final Report Document you can see my final results for each technique.
